# Chessmastah, written Jan 2012 by Svein Arne Roed.
# Contact: svein+roed 'a+t' Gmail
#
# First decided to write my own console chess and used list of lists
# for the board. Mess. Rewrote using dictionary and code is much more
# pleasing to the eyes (mine at least).
#
# This is a simple program (with a cheesy name), but it works.
# Pieces obey their rules, you may not put your king in check and
# the game detects whether you are in check / checkmate.
# Pawns are promoted to Queens if they reach the far edge.
#
# I had a hard time getting IsCheckmate() to work properly, but
# after some googling I found and was inspired by the chessgame made by
# 'Purple Saguaro' here:http://yakinikuman.wordpress.com/python-chess/
# His code is similar to some of mine, but he have taken it much
# further and added AI and a GUI. Recommend to check it out.
#
# This is first release, might add in some (simple) "AI" in due time.
# If I get the time, I'd like to explore networked playing with Python.
# (Need to learn more Python:)
#
# Version 0.4 hereby released in all it's (lack of) glory.
#
# "Look Ma, no Classes!" *Slap*
